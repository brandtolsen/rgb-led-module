# RGB LED module

Project on how to use a KY-016 RGB LED with Arduino to obtain different colors.

### You will need
| Components | Quantity |
| ------------- | :-----: |
| Arduino UNO | x 1 |
| KY-016 RGB LED | x 1 |
| Resistor 220 ohm | x 3 |
| Jumper wires | x 1 |
| Breadboard | x 1 |

### Arduino RGB LED Circuit
Connect the longer pin of RGB led to GND of Arduino and the other three pins to the pin 11, 10, 9 of Arduino through the 220 ohm resistors.
